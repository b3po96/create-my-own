## This is a repository with my own implementations of important concepts, data structures, etc. in various languages. üèóÔ∏è

Each implementation in a particular language will be completed on its own branch, and tagged once completed. Each branch will be marked as `<language>/<project>`, as will the tags, with a versioning of some kind as I iterate.

## Planned Projects:
- Echo Server
- Port Scanner
- HTTP Server
- In-Memory KV Store
  - Grow to a Redis clone
- Realtime Communication Server
- Task Scheduler
- Message Quene System (Kafka clone)
- Version Control System (Git clone)

## Planned Languages:
- Kotlin
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- A lower-level language (Rust/C++/Zig/Go/etc., in the future)

### AI Caveat
The work completed here will be my own, and not the result of vibe coding. My hope is to not use AI as much as I can avoid it, so that I can better learn the concepts. However, I except that I will use AI at some point to better understand concepts or get unstuck. I will commit to never copy code from an LLM, and I will fully understand it before using it.
